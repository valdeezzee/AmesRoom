# AmesRoom
IDS6938 - Mixed Reality for Modeling and Simulation


## Our first project will recreate the "Ames Room" within Virtual Reality (VR).

We will then try to **change the parameters** of the traditional Ames Room, which is a static spatially distorted room, viewed from a single viewing point (door peepkole perspective), into a **variation within VR**.

# The Ames Room Illusion
## An example for the limits and the possibilities of visual perception

The human **perception is dependent on several factors**, like distance, depth, scale, motion, angle, colors and light. Probably the most important factor is **context**, which improves our understanding of the visually perceived information. 

An excellent demonstration on how all these aspects can be used to fail our perception is the Distorted Room Illusion (DRI) (Runeson, 1988), of which the Ames Room is one of the most prominent. Even though these very unregular DRI room layouts (nonrectangular, shape inconsistent) consist mainly of trapezoidal surfaces, they create the illusion of a normal, rectangular and evenly shaped room, with normal measurements, angles and ratio. 

Due to the layout and spacial distortion inside the room, the persons or objects inside of it can appear “out of sync with the environment” with being unusual large or small, depending on where in the room they are located. When moving, these persons/objects even appear to change their own size while doing so, as logic and our experience dictate that the a room is static and stable. 

As a prerequisite for this illusion to work, it is mandatory that these DRI are viewed from a designated point and predetermined aspect angle in the room or even better, just a door-peephole through one of the walls. The success of traditional DRI (Ames room) is largely driven by incorrect depth cues, which results in incorrect size perception. LaValle (2016) explains that the viewer, in order to estimate the size or distance (which relates to size of an object by performing size consistency scaling), must be familiar with the object and have a general idea about its true size. Additionally, the object/scenery has to appear natural, so it doesn’t conflict with the other depth cues in the vicinity. If there is uncertainty about the size of an object, the viewer will use the distance (if known) to improve his size perception, since he can use his experience and knowledge of objects and put them into size-distance context. The farther objects are away, the smaller they seem. If they appear huge even being far away, the size must obviously be tremendous.
