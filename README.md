# AmesRoom
IDS6938 - Mixed Reality for Modeling and Simulation


## Our first project will recreate the "Ames Room" within Virtual Reality (VR).

We will then try to **change the parameters** of the traditional Ames Room, which is a static spatially distorted room, viewed from a single viewing point (door peepkole perspective), into a **variation within VR**.

# The Ames Room Illusion
## An example for the limits and the possibilities of visual perception

The human **perception is dependent on several factors**, like distance, depth, scale, motion, angle, colors and light. Probably the most important factor is **context**, which improves our understanding of the visually perceived information. 

An excellent demonstration on how all these aspects can be used to fail our perception is the Distorted Room Illusion (DRI) (Runeson, 1988), of which the Ames Room is one of the most prominent. Even though these very unregular DRI room layouts (nonrectangular, shape inconsistent) consist mainly of trapezoidal surfaces, they create the illusion of a normal, rectangular and evenly shaped room, with normal measurements, angles and ratio.
