# AmesRoom
IDS6938 - Mixed Reality for Modeling and Simulation


Our first project will recreate the "Ames Room" within Virtual Reality (VR).
We will then try to change the parameters of the traditional Ames Room, which is a static spatially distorted room, viewed from a single viewing point (door peepkole perspective), into a variation within VR.
